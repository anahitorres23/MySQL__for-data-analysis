This project utilizes MySQL and writes SQL queries, for data analysis. 
It incorporates the Big 6 (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY), aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, MAX, AVG, COUNT DISTINCT), the case statement, the IN operator, and joins.
Further, the ability to interpret the results of SQL statements, including database queries and error messages was explore primarily in MySQL Workbench.
